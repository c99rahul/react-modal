# React Modal Dialog w/ the HTML Dialog API

This is an example of demoing the implementation of a modal dialog in React using the HTML Dialog API. The Dialog API is a native API that allows you to create modal dialogs without additional dependencies or libraries. This gives you the benefit of using the accessibility sugar offered by the Dialog API, and it also makes it easy to collect the data received using the modal dialog.

To use this example, clone the repository and import the `Modal` component into your React project. You can then use the `Modal` component to create modal dialogs with any content you want.

# Key Features

* Uses the HTML Dialog API to create modal dialogs
* Hence offers built-in accessibility features for the dialogs
* Allows you to collect data from modal dialogs
* Easy to use, extend, and customize

Let me know if you find any issues with this. Happy coding!
